# Income-Predictor-Random-Forest-Machine-Learning-Model
This is a machine learning model that uses the random forest classifier to predict whether or not someone makes over $50,000 per year.

The data was retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This project is a simple demonstration my technical understanding of building a machine learning program using the random forest classifier, as well as my knowledge of considerations that must be made when developing this type of model.
